# About OverrideAudit

A common practice amongst Sublime Text users is the creation of a
[package override](terminology/overrides.md); a file that is used to modify or
augment the behavior of an existing package to tweak how it works, allowing you
to make Sublime Text truly your own. Overrides allow you to easily "patch" a
package to your liking without having to modify the contents of the package
itself. Power users use overrides for a variety of reasons, and even newer
Sublime Text users sometimes create overrides without being aware that they're
doing it.

While powerful, overrides do have a drawback that can often catch you unaware.
When an override is present, Sublime Text uses it unconditionally, ignoring the
original package file completely. If the author of the package updates it,
you're not told. This could make you miss out on important new features or bug
fixes, or worse.

OverrideAudit was designed to help protect you from these problems. Behind the
scenes, a check is done every time Sublime or one of your packages is updated
to ensure that your overrides are still relevant. With OverrideAudit you can
take a hands on approach to working with your overrides, or just let the
automated checks help keep you abreast of potential problems.

Whether you are a Sublime Text power user with a ton of overrides or even just
a casual user who wants the peace of mind of knowing that you're not missing
out on any package changes, OverrideAudit has you covered.
