Version 2.2.5 (2022-06-06)
--------------------------

  * The hover popup for package information has been updated
    so that the Default package appears to be available in all
    of the plugin hosts.

  * More hover popup help has been added to reports to give some
    easily accessible documentation on the package type legends
    and override types.

  * This will be the last release of OverrideAudit for Sublime
    Text 3.

  For the full details of changes in this version (including
  the switch to Sublime Text 4), check out the CHANGELOG.md file.
