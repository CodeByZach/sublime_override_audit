description: Customizing your OverrideAudit installation
---

OverrideAudit contains some minimal [key bindings](keybinds.md), which are
enabled by default but designed not to conflict with any internal key bindings
and which make it easier to edit overrides and see what is changed.

Additionally, there is a large selection of [settings](settings.md) to control
how OverrideAudit behaves. The default values for each setting are configured
to keep you as up to date and safe as possible while working with overrides,
but can be easily changed to tailor OverrideAudit to work the way you would
like it to work.
