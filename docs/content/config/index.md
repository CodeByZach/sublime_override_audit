description: Customizing your OverrideAudit installation
---

As with most Sublime Text packages, you can configure OverrideAudit to work
better for you.

There are a variety of [settings](settings.md) to control how OverrideAudit
operates, allowing you to customize it to your liking.

There are also some minimal [key bindings](keybinds.md) as well, which are
enabled by default but designed not to conflict with any internal key bindings.
