Version 2.1.0 (2019-09-15)
--------------------------

  * New commands have been added for creating new overrides,
    both by prompting for the override to create as well as by
    promoting a file opened by "View Package File"

  * New command to revert the content of an override back to the
    default without removing the file and a new "confirm_revert"
    setting to enable verification (note: reverts are
    destructive! Make backups if you might want to recover! )

  * Support for Sublime's Incremental Diff to do inline diffs of
    an override based on the underlying package file. This is
    controlled by the new "mini_diff_underlying" setting and is
    enabled by default.

  * Display files in unpacked packages that don't exist in the
    underlying sublime-package file as a warning about unknown
    files. This is controlled by a new "ignore_unknown_overrides"
    setting and is enabled by default.

  * Include informational hover popups when hovering the mouse
    over a package name in a report, including metadata info
    such as name, description and dependencies.

  * Fix bulk diff command, which did not properly hide itself
    when it was not available.

  * Fix a bug in dependency detection that stopped packed
    dependencies from being detected.

  * Fix a bug where the temporary file created for an external
    diff might have the wrong line endings.
