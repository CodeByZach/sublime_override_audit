Version 2.2.0 (2020-01-21)
--------------------------

  * Include a new command to open a resource for viewing, which
    works the same as the PackageResourceViewer command of the
    same name.

  * For packages that contain plugins, the hover popup on reports
    now indicates what version of Python the plugins in that
    package are running in.

  * Fix a problem where some commands did not reload on package
    update.

  For the full details of changes in this version, check out the
  CHANGELOG.md file.
