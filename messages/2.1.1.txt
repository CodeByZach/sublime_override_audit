Version 2.1.1 (2019-11-05)
--------------------------

  * Fix an issue with the new `mini_diff_underlying` setting in
    which if an override was open when you quit Sublime, on
    restart the incremental diff indicators would not properly
    track the underlying package file.

  For the full details of changes in this version, check out the
  CHANGELOG.md file.
