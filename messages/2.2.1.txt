Version 2.2.1 (2020-02-26)
--------------------------

  * Fix the `Open Resource` command, which was incorrectly hiding
    packages that are not represented by a `sublime-package` file
    (such as the `User` package).

  For the full details of changes in this version, check out the
  CHANGELOG.md file.
