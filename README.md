OverrideAudit
=============
[![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/tag/CodeByZach/sublime_override_audit.svg?label=version)](https://github.com/CodeByZach/sublime_override_audit/releases)

OverrideAudit is a package for Sublime Text that helps you detect and work with
your package overrides, allowing you to easily see a list of files that you are
overriding, see what changes your override provides, and most importantly to
provide warnings to you when the file you are overriding has been changed by
its author so you can determine what course of action to take.

If you're new to OverrideAudit, there is an [introductory video](https://youtu.be/qYeli46frR8)
available which shows some of the key features of the package. See also the
[new features](https://youtu.be/NEX9IxLHr_0) added in version 2.1, which are
not covered in the intro video.
